Avoid obstacle is used in obstacle avoidance by creating a virtual box around the player and detecting this virtual box's detection with it

search 1* 1:
Run the code in p5js compiler
This code assumes that bot's sensor work in only its grid and can detect obstacles and goals in 1* 1 box around it

search 3* 3
Run the code in p5js compiler
This code assumes that bot's sensor work in a 3* 3 box around it and can detect obstacles and goals in it
